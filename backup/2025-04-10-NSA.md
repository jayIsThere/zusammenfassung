-------------

### Ethics and Laws

**Lecture Objectives:**

- Understand risks in a connected world.
- Learn IT security protection goals.
- Explore types of attacks and legal aspects.
- Discuss ethical concerns in data protection.

#### Key IT Security Concepts:

- **IT Security**: Ensures data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Information Security**: Protects information, even offline.
- **Cybersecurity**: Focuses on internet-related information security.

**Protection Goals:**

- **Confidentiality**: Only authorized users can access data.
- **Integrity**: Data must remain unaltered.
- **Availability**: Information must be accessible when needed.

#### Types of Attacks:

- **M:1 (Multiple-to-One)**: Many attackers target one victim (e.g., **Denial of Service (DoS)** attack).
- **1:N (One-to-Many)**: One attacker targets several victims (e.g., **Ping Scan**).
- **M:N (Many-to-Many)**: Multiple attackers and victims (e.g., **Spam**).
- **1:1 (One-to-One)**: One attacker targets one victim (e.g., **Port Scan**).

#### Ethical Aspects:

- **White Hat Hackers**: Ethical hackers who improve security.
- **Black Hat Hackers**: Cybercriminals who exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Gray Hat Hackers**: Find vulnerabilities but act without malicious intent.

#### Legal Framework:

- **GDPR**: EU regulation protecting personal data, with heavy fines for violations.

#### Network Threats:

- **Passive Attacks**: Attackers intercept data (e.g., traffic analysis).
- **Active Attacks**: Attackers modify data or disrupt services (e.g., **DoS**).

### The Network Access Layer

#### MAC Address Spoofing & ARP Poisoning

**Positive Aspects of MAC Spoofing:**

- **Prevent Device Tracking**: Randomizing MAC addresses (in Windows/Android) to avoid tracking.
  
**Example**:  
- **Windows 10** allows MAC address randomization when connecting to a Wi-Fi network, making it harder for third parties to track your device's movements.

**Negative Aspects:**

- **ARP Poisoning**: Manipulating ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) packets to intercept data.

**How ARP Poisoning Works:**

- **MITM (Man-In-The-Middle)**: Attacker inserts themselves between two devices (e.g., Workstation 1 and Gateway).
  
**Example**:  
- The attacker sends fake ARP packets to **Workstation 1**, making it think that the attackerâ€™s device is the Gateway. Now, data meant for the Gateway is sent to the attacker instead.

**Countermeasures:**

- **IEEE 802.1X Authentication**: Prevents unauthorized devices from joining the network.
- **Monitoring ARP Traffic**: Tools like **Snort** can detect abnormal ARP activity.

**Practical Exercise**:

- **Wireshark**: Analyze a packet capture file (`arp-spoofing.pcap`) to detect ARP poisoning activity.

### Ethernet & Switch Port Authentication

**Ethernet**: The fundamental network protocol used in local area networks (LANs). It uses **MAC addresses** to communicate between devices.

**Switch Port Authentication**: Ensures only authorized devices can connect to a network by using protocols like **IEEE 802.1X**.
