Java Spring Boot
-------------

### April 13, 2025

Java Spring Boot (Login-function)

What I worked on:
Tried to center a div. That’s it. Sounds simple, right? Nope.

What went wrong:
I tried margin: auto, then flexbox, then grid. Somehow, it still didn’t look right on mobile.

What I learned:
Viewport units can mess with your layout if you're not careful. Also: never trust a div.

Next Steps:
Look into responsive design best practices. Maybe try Tailwind CSS.

Random Thoughts:
I now understand why frontend devs have trust issues.
