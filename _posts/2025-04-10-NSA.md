14.04.2025 - Vorlesung 2: Ethics and Laws, Network Access Layer
-------------

### Ethics and Laws

Objectives of the Lecture:

    Understand the risks in a connected world.

    Develop competencies in various protection goals of IT security.

    Understand different types of attacks and how they work.

    Learn the legal framework in network security.

    Explore ethical aspects of IT security and data protection.

Key Concepts of IT Security:

    IT Security: Protects the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems.

    Information Security: Protects information, even when not processed by IT.

    Cybersecurity: Focuses on all security aspects of information and communication technologies, particularly related to the internet.

Protection Goals:

    Confidentiality: Information should only be accessible to authorized individuals.

    Integrity: Information should not be altered or tampered with.

    Availability: Information and services should always be available and accessible.

Other protection goals include authenticity, anonymity, reliability, non-repudiation, and accountability.
Types of Attacks:

    M:1 Attack (Multiple attackers targeting a single victim) Example: Denial of Service (DoS), where many bots attack a single server.

    1:N Attack (One attacker targeting multiple victims) Example: Ping Scan, where an attacker targets several systems with ping requests.

    M:N Attack (Multiple attackers targeting multiple victims) Example: Spam, where multiple attackers send emails to various victims.

    1:1 Attack (One attacker targeting one victim) Example: Port Scan, where an attacker scans specific ports of a server.

Ethical Aspects:

    White Hat Hackers: Security experts who test vulnerabilities to help improve IT security.

    Black Hat Hackers: Cybercriminals who exploit vulnerabilities for malicious purposes.

    Gray Hat Hackers: Hackers who find vulnerabilities and report them without malicious intent, but sometimes engage in actions that may not be authorized.

Legal and Ethical Framework:

    GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation): A regulation in the EU to protect personal data, ensuring lawful processing and confidentiality. Violations can lead to hefty fines.

Network Threats:

    Passive Attacks: Attacks where the attacker intercepts data without altering it, like traffic flow analysis.

    Active Attacks: Attacks where data is altered, deleted, or disrupted. Examples include data modification and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

### The Network Access Layer

MAC Address Spoofing and ARP Poisoning
Positive Aspects of MAC Address Spoofing

    Preventing Device Tracking:

        Wireless network operators can track devices by their MAC addresses.

        Modern operating systems, like Windows and Android, allow devices to randomize MAC addresses when connecting to Wi-Fi networks. This makes it harder for third parties to track devices.

Negative Aspects of MAC Address Spoofing

    ARP Poisoning (ARP Spoofing):

        This attack occurs when an attacker manipulates the MAC address in ARP packets to impersonate another device on the network.

        The goal of ARP poisoning is to position the attacker as a "man-in-the-middle" (MITM) between two or more systems, allowing the attacker to intercept, modify, or redirect communications.

How ARP Poisoning Works

    Manipulating the ARP Table:

        In an ARP poisoning attack, the attacker poisons the ARP table of victims (e.g., Workstation 1 and Gateway).

        The attacker causes Workstation 1 to send packets meant for the Gateway to the attacker instead.

        Similarly, the attacker makes the Gateway send packets meant for Workstation 1 to the attacker.

ARP Poisoning Attack Example:

    The attacker uses ARP packets to change the ARP table of devices on the network:

        Workstation 1: The attacker changes the table so packets meant for the Gateway go to the attacker instead.

        Gateway: The attacker changes the table so packets meant for Workstation 1 go to the attacker instead.

Countermeasures Against ARP Poisoning

    Switch Port Authentication and Access Control:

        Technologies like IEEE 802.1X can help prevent ARP poisoning attacks by requiring authentication before devices can access the network.

    Monitoring ARP Traffic:

        Tools like arpwatch, Snort, and Suricata can monitor ARP traffic and detect unusual activities like ARP poisoning.

    Static ARP Tables:

        In some cases, static ARP tables can be used to manually map IP addresses to MAC addresses, preventing attackers from changing ARP tables. However, this approach is difficult to scale in large networks.

Practical Exercise

    Wireshark Analysis:

        The lecture encourages students to analyze a provided ARP spoofing packet capture file (arp-spoofing.pcap) using Wireshark.

        The goal is to identify unusual patterns or activities related to ARP poisoning.
